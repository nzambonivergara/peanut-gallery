1. From the home view, the user can:
    - view all movies. 
    - a loading page will display first if the data needs time to load.
    - search movies by title.
    - choose to select a single movie to see more details about that movie.
    - choose to sign in.
2. From the single movie view, the user can:
    - view selected movie details.
    - view the movie's trailer.
    - return to the home view.
4. When the user clicks the sign in button, the user can enter their email and password. When they submit, it takes them to the home page. There is no authentication process as this view was built for the functionality to be completed in a future iteration.
